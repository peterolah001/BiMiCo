\title{Create ASV table from filtered PAIRED-END Illumina reads}
\usage{
asvtab_illPE(filt_out, batch, mtthread = F, mergepairs = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{filt_out}{(Required) Path to filtered reads from previous step (dir containing "DADA2_filt_FWD" and DADA2_filt_REV" dirs)}

\item{batch}{(Required) List indicating the sequencing batch (e.g., a column of phenodata with batch information)}

\item{mtthread}{(Optional) Boolean, enables multithreading (not recommended in Rstudio) Default=F}

\item{mergepairs}{(Optional) Boolean, to merge read pairs (recommended) or only concatenate (if there's no overlap between the majority of reads, it is recommended to inspect trimming). Default=F}
}
\description{
Given a set of PE Illumina sequencing reads pre-filtered by the 'prep_illSE' function, internally generates read error models and outputs chimera-filtered ASV table. ASV table contains ASVs in rows and samples in columns.
